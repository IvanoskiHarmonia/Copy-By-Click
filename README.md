## How To Download

### no GitBash

 I would say the best way to get this app for people that do not have **GitBash** would be:

- Search bar on your computer and type ```Notepad```, and open one, 
- then go back to the **index.html** on my repository and press ```Ctrl+A``` and follow with pressing ```Ctrl+C```, this will copy the whole code of the **index.html** file
- Now go and paste the clipboard to the ```Notepad```,  and just save the file anywhere you want it with the name of: **index.html**, the name doesn't necessarily need to be **index**, but the extension **.html** needs to be included. 

> Note: This way the favicon(**icon**) of this site won't work, but it won't affect anything else.

### GitBash

If you have installed ```GitBash```, by now I would guess that you already know at least a little bit about programming, and how to use it, so in that case: 

``` git clone https://github.com/IvanoskiHarmonia/Copy-By-Click ```

## Populate

- Simple and easy way to do it is as the example in the bottom of the index.html file, array variable is called ```contents``` on line **53 to 57**. 
- Just populate it the same way it's populated in the example.

## How to Test

- Easiest way to test it is to open a new tab: ```Ctrl+T```, go back to this site, click on any of the lines of text, and go back to that tab and just press ```Ctrl+V```.
