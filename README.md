## How To Download


### no Git Bash


I would say the best way to get this app for people that do not have git bash would be:


- Search bar on your computer and type ```Notepad```, and open one,

- then go back to the **index.html** on my repository and press ```Ctrl+A``` and follow with pressing ```Ctrl+C```, this will copy the whole code of the **index.html** file

- Now go and paste the clipboard to the ```Notepad```, and just save the file anywhere you want it with the name of: **index.html**, the name doesn't necessarily need to be **index**, but the extension **.html** needs to be included.


> Note: This way the favicon(**icon**) of this site won't work, but it won't affect anything else.


### Git Bash


If you have installed ```Git Bash```, by now I would guess that you already know at least a little bit about programming, and how to use it, so in that case:


``` git clone https://github.com/IvanoskiHarmonia/copy-by-click ```

## Populate

Simple and easy way to do it is as the example in the bottom of the index.html file, array variable is called contents, just populate it the same way it's populated and you will get what you were hoping for

## Usage

### Input text

- It turns all text into uppercase letters, and selects the whole text. This is primaraly for turning lowercase letters into uppercase ones, for data entry.

### Table

- It helps you track how much each task takes you. Add slashes with a press of ```Spacebar```. **It works everywhere except when input box is focused**. When #U in / has 5 slashes, it adds 5 to #U and gives empty #U in / cell.

- Another feature is: ```Backspace``` - when you press backspace it will allow you to delete slashes, **It works everywhere except when input box is focused**
