## How To Download

  
  

### no Git Bash

  
  

The easiest and most reliable to download this without Git Bash is:

  

- Right above where all the files are located you will see ```Code``` button right next to the buttons ```Go to file``` and ```Add file```, press it, then ```Download ZIP``` will appear at the bottom of the small window, click that and it will download the files into your downloads folder on your local machine.
  
 
 

### Git Bash

  
  

If you have installed ```Git Bash```, by now I would guess that you already know at least a little bit about programming, and how to use it, so in that case:

  
  

``` git clone https://github.com/IvanoskiHarmonia/copy-by-click ```

  

or

  
  ``` git clone https://github.com/IvanoskiHarmonia/copy-by-click ```

## Populate

  

You can populate the table by opening the script.js file in the **src -> js -> script.js** directory, and then using the shortcut ```CTRL+F``` and type: ```change below to change the table```, to find the part where the population of the table is, then use the already added template to create a table of your own liking, finally just save the script.js file.

  

If you want to change the copying section just go to script.js file in **src -> js -> script.js** directory, and then using the shortcut ```CTRL+F``` and type: ```change below to change the copying section```, to find the part where the copying section contents is, then use the already added template to create a copying section of your own liking, finally just save the script.js file.

## Usage

  

### Text for copying

  

- It only copies the part after the ```:``` - **colon**.

  

### Input text

  

- It turns all text into uppercase letters, and selects the whole text. This is primaraly for turning lowercase letters into uppercase ones, for data entry.

  

### Table

  

- Use the arrow up and arrow down to increase the value of the number (it also can be done by just writing any number in the textbox area) -> the number cannot be below 0.


### Dark and Light mode

- On top right corner, you will see that there's a toogle switch that allows you to switch from dark to light and vice-versa
