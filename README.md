### no Git Bush

 I would say the best way to get this app for people that do not have git bush would be:

- Search bar on your computer and type ```Notepad```, and open one, 
- then go back to the **index.html** on my repository and press ```Ctrl+A``` and follow with pressing ```Ctrl+C```, this will copy the whole code of the **index.html** file
- Now go and paste the clipboard to the ```Notepad```,  and just save the file anywhere you want it with the name of: **index.html**, the name doesn't necessarily need to be **index**, but the extension **.html** needs to be included. 

> Note: This way the favicon(**icon**) of this site won't work, but it won't affect anything else.

### Git Bush

If you have installed ```Git Bush```, by now I would guess that you already know at least a little bit about programming, and how to use it, so in that case: 

``` git clone https://github.com/IvanoskiHarmonia/copy-by-click ```

## Populate

Simple and easy way to do it is as the example in the bottom of the index.html file, array variable is called contents, just populate it the same way it's populated and you will get what you were hoping for
